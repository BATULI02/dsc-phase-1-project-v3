As the Senior Data Analyst, I conducted an extensive review of aviation accident data from the National Transportation Safety Board, covering civil aviation incidents between 1948 and 2022. The aim of this analysis is to assist the company in its expansion into the aviation industry by providing data-driven insights to identify aircraft makes and models with the lowest accident or incident rates. By evaluating historical safety trends, I intend to minimize operational risks and deliver strategic recommendations, ensuring informed decisions for both commercial and private aircraft acquisitions.

###Objectives
The objectives for this aviation business venture project are as follows:

- **Assess Aviation Accident Risk**: I will analyze historical aviation accident data to identify aircraft models with the lowest incidence of accidents or incidents, ensuring the selection of the safest options for the companyâ€™s expansion.
  
- **Minimize Operational Risk**: I will offer actionable insights aimed at reducing operational risks, emphasizing safety metrics as the company grows its aviation portfolio.

- **Provide Strategic Guidance**: I will deliver data-driven recommendations to assist the head of the aviation division in making informed decisions regarding aircraft acquisitions for both commercial and private ventures.
## Business Understanding
The company is entering the aviation industry with a focus on making well-informed decisions regarding aircraft purchases and operations for both commercial and private purposes. The primary stakeholder, the Head of the Aviation Division, is responsible for overseeing these decisions. The key business questions guiding this project are:

- **Which aircraft makes and models have the lowest accident risk?**  
  This question focuses on identifying aircraft with strong safety records based on historical data, helping the company invest in reliable and safe options while avoiding those with higher risks.

- **What factors contribute most to aviation accidents, and how can the company mitigate these risks?**  
  Understanding the root causes of accidents allows the company to make informed decisions about maintenance, pilot training, and operational standards to enhance safety.

- **How have accident rates evolved over time?**  
  This question aims to reveal trends in aviation safety, helping assess whether the industry is becoming safer and if it's a viable business opportunity.

By answering these questions, the company will be better positioned to make data-driven decisions, reducing risks and ensuring the selection of safe, strategic aircraft.
## Data Understanding and Analysis
